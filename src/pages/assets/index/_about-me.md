I&nbsp;write back-end applications in **Spring Boot** and modern front-ends using **TypeScript** (**Angular**).

I&nbsp;work in a cloud-native environment in the "you build it, you run it" model. Apart from building microservices, I use and extend **Kubernetes**.

I'm open source and cloud-native enthusiast.
