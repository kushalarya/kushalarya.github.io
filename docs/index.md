# Notebook

This space is dedicated to sharing all of my knowledge about the world.

It includes my thoughts, ideas, notes, and knowledge. Think of this as personal wiki and experimental knowledge base.

## Digital Garden

Digital gardens are curated and evolve over time, sometimes growing wildly and sometimes getting pruned.

Digital gardens are less focused on publishing highly polished results but more about the process of developing ideas, thoughts, and knowledge over time. Less personal branding and SEO but more personal growth and development instead.

## Improve the wiki

If you come across any errors, particularly if there is something I've stated that is clearly incorrect, I kindly request you to fork this repository and submit a pull request with the necessary corrections.
Alternatively, you can open an issue to express your thoughts on what you believe is incorrect, ask questions, or provide suggestions.

I welcome any constructive feedback and suggestions for enhancing the content.

## Thankyou
