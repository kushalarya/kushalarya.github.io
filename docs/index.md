# Notebook

This space is dedicated to sharing all of my knowledge about the world.

It includes my thoughts, ideas, notes, and knowledge. Think of this as a personal wiki and experimental knowledge base.

## Digital Garden

[Digital Garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/) is a collection of evolving notes, essays, and ideas.

These are less focused on publishing highly polished results but more on the process of developing ideas, thoughts, and knowledge over time. Less personal branding and SEO but more personal growth and development instead.

These are curated and evolve, sometimes growing wildly and sometimes getting pruned.

## Improve the wiki
