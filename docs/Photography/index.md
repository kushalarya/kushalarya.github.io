# Photography

Photographs play an important role in everyone's lives because they allow us to keep in touch with the past and bring back fond memories of special times, people, and places.

> Photography is an Art

Hobbies are important for mental health and happiness. Fantastic pastimes.

## My Gear

I currently own Sony ZV-E10. It's a versatile APSC camera for Photography & Videos. The small body of this camera allows me to carry it everywhere.

All my photographs are with Sony's kit 18-50mm lens. I'm planning to upgrade the lens, but first I want to gain confidence in creating great compositions.
