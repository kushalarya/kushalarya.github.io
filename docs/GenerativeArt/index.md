# Generative Art

Generative art, a technique where the artist creates print or onscreen images by using computer algorithms, finds the artistic intersection of programming, computer graphics, and individual expression.

I got interested in generative art from [Joshua Davis](https://joshuadavis.com/)'s talk at W3Conf 2013 called "[Beyond Play: The Art of Creative Coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJS4fBjdPM4&ab_channel=W3C)".

Started learning [Processing](https://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted). Did my experiments with it.

Found a new JavaScript library called p5.js which is an interpretation of Processing. Followed & learned from one of my favorite teachers [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman).

Will be adding my experiments here soon.
