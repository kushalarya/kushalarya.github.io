My Goal: **Fat loss**

Calculating your daily calorie, protein, and fat needs for fat loss involves several factors, including your age, gender, weight, height, activity level, and weight loss goals.

### Step 1: Calculate Your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)

BMR represents the number of calories your body needs at rest to maintain basic functions such as breathing, circulation, and cell production. You can use the Mifflin-St Jeor equation to estimate your BMR

For men:
BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × weight in kg) + (4.799 × height in cm) - (5.677 × age in years)

For women:
BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 × weight in kg) + (3.098 × height in cm) - (4.330 × age in years)

### Step 2: Determine Your Activity Level

Multiply your BMR by an activity factor to account for your daily activity level:

- Sedentary (little to no exercise): BMR × 1.2
- Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days a week): BMR × 1.375
- Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days a week): BMR × 1.55
- Very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week): BMR × 1.725
- Super active (very hard exercise/sports & physical job or training twice a day): BMR × 1.9

### Step 3: Set Your Caloric Intake for Fat Loss

To lose fat, you typically want to create a calorie deficit. A common guideline is to aim for a deficit of 500 to 1,000 calories per day, which can lead to a safe and sustainable weight loss of about 1kg per week.

So, subtract 500 to 1,000 calories from your daily calorie needs calculated in step 2 to determine your daily calorie intake for fat loss.

### Step 4: Divide target calories into macronutrients

Macronutrients: Protein, Carbohydrates, and Fats

- For Maintenance mode 
    - Fat 25-35%
    - Protein 25-35%
    - Carb 30-50%

- For Lean mode
    - Fat 30-40%
    - Protein 40-50%
    - Carb 10-20%


:::note Note

1 gram Fat - 9 calories
1 gram Protein - 4 calories
1 gram Carbohydrates - 4 calories

** My calculations ** ( Date: September 8th, 2023 )

Daily Calorie Needs = BMR (1865) × Activity Factor (1.55) ≈ 2,894.75 calories per day

Target Calories = 2894 - 1000 ≈ 1800 calories per day

Fat: 540 calories
Protein: 900 calories
Carbohydrates: 360 calories


Minimum Protein Intake: 1.2 grams/kg x 82 kg = 98.4 grams of protein per day
Maximum Protein Intake: 2.2 grams/kg x 82 kg = 180.4 grams of protein per day
