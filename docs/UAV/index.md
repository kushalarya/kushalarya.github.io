# UAV

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are categorized into 4 groups

1. Fixed-Wings
2. Multi-Rotor
3. Single-Rotor
4. Hybrid vertical take-off & Landing (VTOL)

My interest mainly goes toward Fixed-wings and Multi-rotors.

I have built a few fixed-wing trainers and a few FPV drones from scratch, which I usually take for flight tests on weekend mornings. If you don't see me at the flying club that means I'm spending time fixing these aircraft which I crashed the previous weekend.

## My Gear

1. FrSky Taranis X9D+ Transmitter
2. R-XSR, XM+ receiver
3. Eachine EV300O Goggles

## Inspirations

I have been watching RC vehicle videos since childhood. It was always fascinating to me how these small things take days/months for just one complete build. And then finally testing and improving these for more speed or acceleration.

During the 2020 lockdown, I had some time that I saved from my daily commute to-from office. So I ordered parts for building FT210 Quad and followed [FlightTest's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TeNwwcPXxI&ab_channel=FliteTest)
