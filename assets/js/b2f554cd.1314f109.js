Recently I\'ve felt a need to start creating content. Or, more like get back into doing it.\\n\\nThe last time I had a blog was more than 15 years ago. As a teenager, I used to run the \\"My IT News\\" WordPress site with, as you may expect, news around IT - especially the new consumer electronics products. While it didn\'t have much attention (as far as I remember, around ~5k unique visitors per month), I enjoyed doing it. But I had plenty of time and energy back then. Today I\'m struggling with both, so... I\'m starting a new blog! That makes sense, right?\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### Why yet another blog\\n\\nNowadays, everyone has their own blog. Do I really need to become another wannabe influencer?\\n\\nNo. What I want to achieve is:\\n\\n- structure my knowledge and record what I\'ve learned recently,\\n- try out new ways to increase productivity, stay motivated and avoid burnout,\\n- improve my English (as a non-native English speaker),\\n- develop self-discipline, reduce procrastination, and, as a result, save time to do the things mentioned above.\\n\\nSo, as you can see, it\'s mostly for me, but I hope you\'ll benefit from this as well.\\n\\n### What to expect\\n\\nWell, definitely shorter, more concise blog posts, like this one.\\n\\n<center>\\n\\n![Ain\'t nobody got time for that](./assets/aint-nobody-got-time-for-that.gif) <br/><small>source: <a href=\\"https://tenor.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">tenor.com</a></small>\\n\\n</center>\\n\\nWhile I have a few ideas for new blog posts in mind, I don\'t want to limit myself to just technical topics. Instead, I will probably touch on different areas of my interest, such as:\\n\\n- full-stack technical topics related to the technologies I use (Go, Kubernetes, React.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, GraphQL, gRPC...),\\n- personal projects announcements,\\n- new talks announcements\\n- open source,\\n- cool projects and apps I stumbled upon,\\n- productivity,\\n- personal growth (i.e. soft skills),\\n- finance.\\n\\nYup, that\'s a lot - but we\'ll see how it goes.\\n\\nAt some point, I would also like to experiment with the form of the content. Videos, podcasts? Maybe one day..."}]}')}}]);
