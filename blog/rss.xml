            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to social media, I'm definitely more a reader than a writer type of person. Recently I've felt a need to start creating content. Or, more like get back into doing it.</p>
<p>The last time I had a blog was more than 15 years ago. As a teenager, I used to run the "My IT News" WordPress site with, as you may expect, news around IT - especially the new consumer electronics products. While it didn't have much attention (as far as I remember, around ~5k unique visitors per month), I enjoyed doing it. But I had plenty of time and energy back then. Today I'm struggling with both, so... I'm starting a new blog! That makes sense, right?</p>
<h3 id="why-yet-another-blog">Why yet another blog</h3>
<p>Nowadays, everyone has their own blog. Do I really need to become another wannabe influencer?</p>
<p>No. What I want to achieve is:</p>
<ul>
<li>structure my knowledge and record what I've learned recently,</li>
<li>try out new ways to increase productivity, stay motivated and avoid burnout,</li>
<li>improve my English (as a non-native English speaker),</li>
<li>develop self-discipline, reduce procrastination, and, as a result, save time to do the things mentioned above.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, as you can see, it's mostly for me, but I hope you'll benefit from this as well.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-expect">What to expect</h3>
<p>Well, definitely shorter, more concise blog posts, like this one.</p>

<p>While I have a few ideas for new blog posts in mind, I don't want to limit myself to just technical topics. Instead, I will probably touch on different areas of my interest, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>full-stack technical topics related to the technologies I use (Go, Kubernetes, React.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, GraphQL, gRPC...),</li>
<li>personal projects announcements,</li>
<li>new talks announcements</li>
<li>open source,</li>
<li>cool projects and apps I stumbled upon,</li>
<li>productivity,</li>
<li>personal growth (i.e. soft skills),</li>
<li>finance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yup, that's a lot - but we'll see how it goes.</p>
<p>At some point, I would also like to experiment with the form of the content. Videos, podcasts? Maybe one day...</p>]]></content:encoded>
